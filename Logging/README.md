# OCP Logging

The logging subsystem aggregates the following types of logs:
- application - Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, except infrastructure container applications.
- infrastructure - Logs generated by infrastructure components running in the cluster and OpenShift Container Platform nodes, such as journal logs. Infrastructure components are pods that run in the openshift*, kube*, or default projects.
- audit - Logs generated by auditd, the node audit system, which are stored in the /var/log/audit/audit.log file, and the audit logs from the Kubernetes apiserver and the OpenShift apiserver.
